/**
 * @class CustomizedConsent
 * @extends BaseContext
 * implements CustomizedConsentMembers
 * description Manages interactions for the "customized-consent" screen.
 * This screen allows users to review and consent to an application's request for
 * specific OAuth scopes and potentially more detailed authorization details (e.g., RAR).
 *
 * It provides methods to `accept` or `deny` the consent request.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // How to use the CustomizedConsent screen SDK:
 * import CustomizedConsent from '@auth0/auth0-acul-js/customized-consent';
 *
 * // Instantiate the manager for the customized consent screen
 * const consentManager = new CustomizedConsent();
 *
 * // Accessing screen data
 * const clientName = consentManager.client.name;
 * const userEmail = consentManager.user.email;
 * const requestedScopes = consentManager.screen.scopes;
 * const authorizationDetails = consentManager.screen.authorizationDetails;
 *
 * console.log(`${clientName} is requesting consent from ${userEmail}.`);
 * console.log("Requested Scopes:", requestedScopes);
 * console.log("Authorization Details:", authorizationDetails);
 *
 * // Accessing transaction errors from a previous attempt
 * const transactionErrors = consentManager.transaction.errors;
 * if (transactionErrors && transactionErrors.length > 0) {
 *   transactionErrors.forEach(error => {
 *     console.error(`Error: ${error.message}`);
 *     // Display these errors to the user.
 *   });
 * }
 *
 * // Example of handling consent acceptance
 * async function onAcceptConsent() {
 *   try {
 *     await consentManager.accept();
 *     // On success, Auth0 will typically redirect.
 *   } catch (e) {
 *     console.error('Failed to accept consent:', e);
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * // Example of handling consent denial
 * async function onDenyConsent() {
 *   try {
 *     await consentManager.deny({ denial_reason: "user_declined" });
 *     // On success, Auth0 will typically redirect.
 *   } catch (e) {
 *     console.error('Failed to deny consent:', e);
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
