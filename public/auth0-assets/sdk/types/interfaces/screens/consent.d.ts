 *
 * @property {object | null} data - Screen-specific data.
 * @property {Scope[]} data.scopes - An array of {@link Scope} objects detailing each permission being requested.
 *                                   This is the core information displayed to the user on the consent screen.
 * @property {boolean} data.hideScopes - A boolean flag indicating whether the list of scopes should be hidden from the user.
