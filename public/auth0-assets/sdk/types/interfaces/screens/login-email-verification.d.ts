 * - `screen`: UI texts and general screen information. No screen-specific `data` fields are uniquely defined for `login-email-verification` beyond standard ones.
 * - `transaction`: Details of the ongoing transaction, including state and any errors from previous attempts (e.g., "invalid-code").

     * to the Auth0 `/u/login-email-verification` endpoint.
     *
     * If the code is valid, Auth0 will typically redirect the user to the next step in the
     * authentication flow. If the code is invalid, expired, or another error occurs,
     * Auth0 will usually re-render the login-email-verification screen, and the
     * `transaction.errors` array in the SDK's context will be updated with details

     *                          It does not return data directly upon resolution, as a redirect or
     *                          page re-render is the common outcome.
     * @throws {Error} Throws an error if `payload.code` is not provided or is not a string,
     *                 or if the `FormHandler` encounters an unrecoverable issue during submission (e.g., network error).
     *                 Validation errors from Auth0 (like an invalid code) are not thrown as JavaScript errors
     *                 but are reflected in `this.transaction.errors` after the operation.

     *   console.error("Failed to submit the verification code:", error);
