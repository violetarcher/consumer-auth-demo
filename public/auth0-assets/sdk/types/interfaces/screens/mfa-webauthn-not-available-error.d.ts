/**
 * @interface MfaWebAuthnNotAvailableErrorMembers
 * @extends BaseMembers
 * description Defines the members (properties and methods) for interacting with the 'mfa-webauthn-not-available-error' screen.
 * This screen is displayed when a WebAuthn authenticator (platform or roaming) is not available or supported
 * by the user's browser or device during an MFA flow, preventing WebAuthn from being used.
 * It typically offers the user an option to try a different authentication method.
 * Note: The screen itself does not have specific data properties beyond the base `ScreenMembers`;
 * its purpose is to inform the user and allow them to select an alternative MFA method.

     *   // Potentially update UI to inform the user of the failure.
