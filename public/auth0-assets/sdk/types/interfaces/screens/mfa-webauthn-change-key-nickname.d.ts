    /**
     * Submits the new nickname for the WebAuthn security key.
     * This action corresponds to the user entering a new nickname and clicking a "Save" or "Continue" button.
     * The SDK will POST this new nickname to the Auth0 `/u/mfa-webauthn-change-key-nickname` endpoint.
     *
     * If the new nickname is valid and the update is successful, Auth0 will typically redirect the user
     * to the next appropriate screen (e.g., back to MFA factor management or a success confirmation).
     * If the nickname is invalid (e.g., empty, too long, too short), Auth0 will re-render the
     * 'mfa-webauthn-change-key-nickname' screen, and the `transaction.errors` array in the SDK's
     * context will be updated with details about the validation failure.

     * @returns {Promise<void>} A promise that resolves when the form submission is initiated.
     *                          It does not return data directly upon resolution, as a redirect or
     *                          page re-render is the common outcome.
     * @throws {Error} Throws an error if `payload.nickname` is not provided or is not a string,
     *                 or if the `FormHandler` encounters an unrecoverable issue during submission (e.g., network error).
     *                 Validation errors from Auth0 (like an invalid nickname) are not thrown as JavaScript errors
     *                 but are reflected in `this.transaction.errors` after the operation.
     *
     * @example
     * ```typescript
     * // Assuming 'sdk' is an instance of MfaWebAuthnChangeKeyNickname
     * const newNickname = "My Favorite YubiKey"; // Value from user input
     * try {
     *   await sdk.continueWithNewNickname({ nickname: newNickname });
     *   // If successful, page redirects.
     * } catch (error) {
     *   // This catch is for unexpected errors during the SDK call itself.
     *   console.error("Failed to submit the new nickname:", error);
     * }
     * // After the await, always check sdk.transaction.errors for server-side validation issues.
     * if (sdk.transaction.errors && sdk.transaction.errors.length > 0) {
     *   sdk.transaction.errors.forEach(err => {
     *     if (err.field === 'nickname') {
     *       // Display err.message related to the nickname input field.
     *       // e.g., "Name is too short", "Name is required"
